JavaScript is a **loosely typed** and **dynamic** language. It means, when a new variable is declared in JavaScript, it is not associated with any type.

```javascript
var a; // Just a declared variable
```

In a loosely typed language like JavaScript, variable `a` can be assigned with a value of any type. The variable `a`, can then be re-assigned with another type.

```javascript
a = "Hello"; // Assigned with String type
a = 10; // Re-assigned with Number type
```

## Data types

There are **7** data types as per ECMAScript standard.

1. Boolean
2. Null
3. Undefined
4. Number
5. String
6. Symbol
7. Object

First 6 types are collectively called as **primitive** types. Any variable that does not fall under any of the primitive types are Object type.
