# React Code Splitting Interview Questions

**Question**

How code-splitting helps to boost the performance of a React app?

**Solution**

Code-splitting a React app helps to load only the essential code on initial page load. Rest of the code is dynamically included on demand. So, even though overall amount of code does not change, the app load time and performance dramatically improves.
