# SOLVED: ControlLabel from React Bootstrap throws Warning

When we try to install `react-bootstrap`, at the time of writing, __version 1.0.0-beta.16__ is installed. This version of `react-bootstrap` does not export a component with name `ControlLabel`. So if we try to use it in our code like:

```html
<FormGroup>
  <ControlLabel>Person</ControlLabel>
  <FormControl className="input-person" onChange={this.onPersonChange}/>
</FormGroup>
```

It will throw a warning, saying:

```
Warning: React.createElement: type is invalid -- expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```
<Image src={imageControlLabel} alt="Control label warning" />

`ControlLabel` was in older versions of `react-bootstrap`. Instead of `ControlLabel`, we can import `FormLabel` and use it to solve the issue.

```javascript
import { Form, FormGroup, FormControl, ControlLabel, Button } from "react-bootstrap";

//...

<FormGroup>
  <FormLabel>Person</FormLabel>
  <FormControl className="input-person" onChange={this.onPersonChange}/>
</FormGroup>
```

Above code shows the updated import statement and the updated JSX to be used inside React component.
