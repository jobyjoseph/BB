# React Hooks Interview Questions

**Question**

What are hooks in React?

**Answer**

Hooks are a new feature added in React v16.8. It allows to use all React features without writing class components. For example, before version 16.8, we need a class component to manage state of a component. Now we can keep state in a functional component using `useState` hook.

**Question**

Will React hooks work inside class components?

**Answer**

No

**Question**

Why React hooks was introduced?

**Answer**

One reason to introduce hooks was the complexity in dealing with `this` keyword inside class components. If not handled properly, `this` will take some other value. That will result in breaking lines like `this.setState()` and other event handlers. Using hooks, we avoid that complexity when working with functional components.

Class components do not minify very well and also make hot reloading unreliable. That is another inspiration to bring hooks.

Another reason is that, there is no specific way to reuse stateful component logic. Even though HOC and render props patterns address this problem, that asks for modifying the class component code. Hooks allow to share stateful logic without changing the component hierarchy.

Fourth reason is, in a complex class component, related code are scattered in different lifecycle methods. Example, in case of a data fetching, we do that mainly in `componentDidMount()` and `componentDidUpdate()`. Another example is, in case of event listeners, we use `componentDidMount()` to bind an event and `componentWillUnmount()` to unbind. Hooks instead helps to place related code together.

**Question**

How `useState` hook works? What is/are the arguments accepted by this hook and what is returned by the hook?

**Solution**

`useState` hook is a function which is used to store state value in a functional component. It accepts an argument as the initial value of the state. It returns an array with 2 elements. First element is the current value of state. Second element is a function to update the state.

We import `useState` first from React by

```javascript
import React, {useState} from "react";
```

Later we use `useState` like:

```javascript
const [currentStateValue, functionToUpdateState] = useState(initialStateValue);
```

**Question**

Here we have a class component with a state value. Each time the button in component is clicked, the count is incremented.

```javascript
class Counter extends Component {
  state = {
    count: 0,
  };

  incrementCount = () => {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1,
    });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.incrementCount}>Count: {this.state.count}</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Rewrite this component using React hooks.

**Solution**

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setCount(count + 1);
        }}
      >
        Count: {count}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Question**

Below we have a class component. It contains code to update the state based on previous state value.

```javascript
class Counter extends Component {
  state = {
    count: 0,
  };

  incrementCount = () => {
    this.setState((prevState) => {
      return {
        count: prevState.count + 1,
      };
    });
  };

  decrementCount = () => {
    this.setState((prevState) => {
      return {
        count: prevState.count - 1,
      };
    });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <strong>Count: {this.state.count}</strong>
        <button onClick={this.incrementCount}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={this.decrementCount}>Decrement</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Rewrite the above code using React hooks.

**Solution**

One can update the value of a state variable just by passing the new value to update function or by passing a callback function. Second technique which accepts a callback function is safe to use.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount((prevCount) => {
      return prevCount + 1;
    });
  };

  const decrementCount = () => {
    setCount((prevCount) => {
      return prevCount - 1;
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <strong>Count: {count}</strong>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrementCount}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Question**

Here we have class component that updates the state using the input from a form.

```javascript
export class Profile extends Component {
  state = {
    name: "Backbencher",
    age: 23,
  };

  onNameChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({
      name: e.target.value,
    });
  };

  onAgeChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({
      age: e.target.value,
    });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <form>
          <input
            type="text"
            value={this.state.name}
            onChange={this.onNameChange}
          />
          <input
            type="text"
            value={this.state.age}
            onChange={this.onAgeChange}
          />
          <h2>
            Name: {this.state.name}, Age: {this.state.age}
          </h2>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Rewrite the same component using React hooks.

**Solution**

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Profile() {
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState({
    name: "Backbencher",
    age: 24,
  });

  const onNameChange = (e) => {
    setProfile({ ...profile, name: e.target.value });
  };

  const onAgeChange = (e) => {
    setProfile({ ...profile, age: e.target.value });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <form>
        <input type="text" value={profile.name} onChange={onNameChange} />
        <input type="text" value={profile.age} onChange={onAgeChange} />
        <h2>
          Name: {profile.name}, Age: {profile.age}
        </h2>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The setter function of `useState()` does not automatically merge if an object is stored in state. But in case of `setState()` method in class components, auto merging happens.

Here we are merging object properties with the help of JavaScript spread operator.
