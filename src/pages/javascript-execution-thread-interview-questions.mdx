# JavaScript Execution Thread Interview Questions

**Question 1:**

What is the output printed in the console? Explain the code with memory consumed and call stack utilization.

```javascript{numberLines: true}
var a = 4;

function baaz() {
  a = 6;
  boom();
}

function boom() {
  var a = 8;
}

baaz();
console.log(a);
```

**Solution:**

It prints `6` in browser console. 

In the global context, named memory locations are allocated for `a`, `baaz`, `boom`. When function `baaz` is called(_line 12_), it is added to call stack and a new execution context is created for `baaz`. `baaz` updates the value of `a` in global context to 6(_line 4_). When `baaz` calls `boom`, a new stack is added on top of `baaz` in call stack. Also a new execution context is created for `boom`. `boom` allocate a memory location for `a` in its local memory(_line 9_). Therefore, the global `a` is not updated. Hence finally, the value 6 is printed.
