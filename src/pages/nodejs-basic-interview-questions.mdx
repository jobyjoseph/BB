# Node.js Basic Interview Questions

**Question**

What is the significance of _package-lock.json_ file?

**Solution**

When we install a NPM package and saving the dependency in _package.json_, a _package-lock.json_ file is automatically created. It helps during production deployment. Let us see how.

Say, as part of our project, when we install _react_, the version installed is _^16.8.0_. After 3 months, when we deploy the code in production, if run `npm install`, the react version might be _16.8.1_. Because `^` says it can accept bug fixes. So in production deployment we need to run `npm ci` to install exactly the same versions used while development. This avoids issues to due version mismatch.
