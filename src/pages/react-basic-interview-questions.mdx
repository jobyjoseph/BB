# React Basic Interview Questions

**Question**

What is virtual DOM? How virtual DOM boosts React performance?

**Solution**

Like the actual DOM, the virtual DOM is a node tree that lists elements, their attributes and content as objects and properties. `render()` method in ReactDOM creates a node tree from React components and updates this tree in response to mutations in the data model caused by actions.

Whenever anything is changed, the entire UI is first re-rendered in virtual DOM representation. The difference between earlier virtual DOM representation and current one is calculated. The real DOM is updated with what has actually changed. Updating virtual DOM is very fast compared to real browser re-render. Hence performance is improved.

**Question**

In a React project, we add reference to 2 files. One is _react.js_ and other one is _react-dom.js_. Why we have two include 2 files, instead of one?

**Solution**

React component library is used in websites and also to create mobile apps using React Native. React.js file is a small file which does the job of creating components. Therefore it is used in both web and React-Native projects. In web, the components are then rendered in browser using react-dom.js. So the 2 files are separated for reusability.

**Question**

We have a JSX code snippet below.

```javascript
const content = (
  <div>
    <h1>Backbencher</h1>
  </div>
);
```

Write the pure JavaScript code after JSX is converted to JavaScript.

**Solution**

```javascript
const content = React.createElement(
  "div",
  {},
  React.createElement("h1", {}, "Backbencher")
);
```

**Question**

Explain the parameters of `React.createElement()` method.

**Solution**

`React.createElement()` accepts three arguments.

```javascript
createElement(tag, attributes, children)
```

The fist parameter is tag or component to be rendered. Second parameter accepts an object. The key value pair of the object forms the attribute list of the tag. Third parameter can be a string or other component to be nested inside current tag or component. Here is an example.

```javascript
React.createElement("div", {id: "hello"}, "Backbencher")
```

turns out to be

```html
<div id="hello">Backbencher</div>
```
