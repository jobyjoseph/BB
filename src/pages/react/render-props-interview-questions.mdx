** Question: **

What is the advantage of Render Props?

** Answer: **

Main advantage is code reusability. For eg: There is a mega-menu component created by some third party developer. The component renders menu items and sub-menu items in the following html format.

```html
<ul class="menu">
  <li>Menu Item 1
    <ul class="sub-menu">
      <li>Sub menu 1</li>
      <li>Sub menu 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
```

If the user wants to add some content below each sub-menu, he / she needs to edit the library code. Using Render props the developer of the library can give the flexibility to the user to add custom content below the sub-menu.
