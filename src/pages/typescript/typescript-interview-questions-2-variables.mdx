# TypeScript Interview Questions Part 2 - Variables

** Question: **

We have a JavaScript code that declares 3 variables and later assigns value to those variables.

```typescript
let car;
let model;
let isSedan;
car = "BMW";
model = 2018;
isSedan = true;
```

How can we add types to the declared variables using TypeScript syntax?

** Answer: **

We can add type information along with each variable declaration as shown below.

```typescript
let car: string;
let model: number;
let isSedan: boolean;
car = "BMW";
model = 2018;
isSedan = true;
```

- type inference
- using type with const variables
