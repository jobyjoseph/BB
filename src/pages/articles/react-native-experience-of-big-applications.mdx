# React Native Experience of High Traffic Apps

React Native is an open-source solution from Facebook that can deliver both iOS and Android apps from a single code base. React Native is very popular. Still, a heated debate is going on if it is the right solution to be used for making apps.

Here is a set of apps that are developed using React Native. You can view a big list on React Native [website](https://reactnative.dev/showcase.html).

## Code Reusability

In [Discord](https://discord.com/), they tried React Native from the time it was launched. React Native helps Discord to reuse code across platforms. This helped them to develop a small and efficient team.

## Over the Air Patches

When using React Native, it is possible to do minor patches without going through the approval process. In Discord, it helps developers to ship more often with confidence.

## Platform Reusability

React Native consists of two words, "React" and "Native". "React" is more familiar for web developers and "Native" is more familiar for native app developers. Most of the app development goes smoothly with just React Native features. But sometimes, the app requires some native feature that React-Native does not support out of the box. In such scenarios, as per the comment from Discord, native developers can succeed much faster than web developers.

Web developers might need help from native app developers. But, once they grow they can share valuable information across front-end platforms.

## Startup Delay

Time to Interaction (TTI) is a key aspect of how a user perceives the performance of an app. Since React Native loads and parses all the Javascript code before execution, you get startup delay based on bundle size. Discord was facing a startup delay of 1.5sec to download their 15mb bundle.

Fortunately, Facebook documented [unbundling](https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance#unbundling-inline-requires) to only load necessary portions of the bundle for startup and progressively load more as needed via their packager.
