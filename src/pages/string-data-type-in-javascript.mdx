# String Data Type

In JavaScript, _String_ is a primitive data type. It is used in JavaScript to work with texts.

Here is an example of a string.

```javascript
"backbencher!"
```

Each character in a string occupy __16 bits__. Number of 16-bit values in a string forms the length of the string. The length of above string is 12.

## Unicode Support

Each character in a string occupies 16 bits to consider Unicode characters. Since JavaScript supports unicode characters, we can use unicodes in our texts. Here we are going to assign a malayalam language word to a variable.

```javascript
const fruit = "ആപ്പിൾ";
console.log(fruit); // "ആപ്പിൾ"
```
