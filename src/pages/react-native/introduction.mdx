# Introduction

It is easy to create both Android and iOS apps at the same time using React Native. Android and iOS users cover 99% of market.

When maintaining 2 different teams to handle Android and iOS development, it is difficult to manage code, releases and also man power. The aim of Facebook through React Native is to achieve:

- Fully native apps(no PWA or web views)
- One codebase
- One development team
- One programming language, ie JavaScript
- Fully extensible to implement features that are not supported by React Native

React Native is getting better. Facebook, with its new JavaScript compiler [Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev/) makes app launch faster, efficient memory management and easy integration.
