# Getting Started With Expo

Expo is a third party tool to head fast with React Native development. There are situations when we need to eject the project from Expo and move forward. We will talk about that later. Now let us try to understand Expo more.

## Expo Installation

In order to install Expo in our machine, we first need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. If you successfully install Node.js or if it is already installed, you can verify it by typing following command.

```
> node --version
v12.14.1
```

Next using Node's package manager, we install `expo-cli` package globally.

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Our `expo` command is ready.

## Setup Project

Navigate to a folder where we need to setup our React Native project. Run this command to initialize a project.

```
expo init AwesomeProjectExpo
```

Running above command lists a set of options.

In brief, these are some options with which to start a new project. Select __blank__ option for now.

Expo command will setup a React Native project. It also shows what can be done next with some commands.

## Run Project

The `expo init` command is setting up a base project. Navigate to the newly created project folder `AwesomeProjectExpo`.

```
cd AwesomeProjectExpo
```

If `yarn` is installed we can run `start` command using `yarn`. Or else we can use `npm` to run `start command`.

```
npm run start
```

Expo will now run a server and show the output in the browser. It looks like this:

The QR code we see is going to be the connector between our laptop and phone. Next let us see how our base app looks like in a mobile device.

## View App in Mobile

First of all, in order to see the app in our phone, we need to install Expo app in our phone. Expo app is available both iOS Appstore and Google Playstore.

Mine is an android phone. Search for Expo in play store.

<Image src={imageExpoPlayStore} alt="Expo in Playstore" style={{maxWidth: "400px"}}/>

Once the app is installed, open the app. Click on _Scan QR Code_ from _Projects_ screen.

<Image src={imageExpoProjectsScreen} alt="Expo Projects" style={{maxWidth: "400px"}}/>

Scan the QR code shown in your laptop.

If you are seeing an error saying _192.168.255.103:19000 is not accessible_, ensure that both laptop and phone are connected to same wifi.

If everything went well, Expo will download the necessary files to the phone and show the output.

That is basically our Hello World application using Expo.
