# JavaScript Closures Interview Questions

**Question**

What is a closure?

**Solution**

Here is a definition given by Kyle Simpson in Advanced JavaScript course.

> Closure is when a function "remembers" its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that lexical scope.

One of the easy way to meet this condition is when a function returns another function. That is why usually during interviews, when asked about closures, candidates say "When a function returns another function, that is a closure.".

Example of a closure.

```javascript{numberLines: true}
function a(){
  const name = "Backbencher";

  function b() {
    console.log(name);
  }

  return b;
}

const c = a();
c(); // "Backbencher"
```

Here is how we explain Kyle's definition with above example.

Closure is when a function(`b()`) remembers its lexical scope(`name` is part of the scope) even when the function is executed outside(global scope) that lexical scope(scope of `a()`).
