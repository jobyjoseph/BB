# Soku - The Guessing Game - Part 1

I am a JavaScript developer. I **do not know mobile app development**. But I wish to launch a guessing game in App store. I can spare **30 mins daily** for this project. Every day, I will log what I did. My goal is to generate **$2000 dollars monthly** from this app. Let us see what all I need to do.

### Day 1 - Jul 19, 2020

Today I spent thinking about this app. Then googled for a short name. Then searched play store for existing names.

#### The App

This game is named **Soku**, meaning _immediately_ in Japanese. The game is quick and I want a short name for the app. So it ended with Soku.

The inspiration came from a <a href="https://flipkart.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Flipkart</a> game, which I used to play everyday with 100% concentration :). That game's name is **Guess What**.

<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<Image src={imageGuessWhat} style={{maxWidth: "300px"}} alt="Guess What"/>
</div>

I am going to make it more generic. Users can create their own guessing game using Soku.

### Day 2 - Jul 20, 2020

Today it is holiday for me. So I am spending around 2 hours with the app. I designed a basic wireframe to start with using Adobe XD.

<Image src={imageSokuWireframe} alt="Soku Wireframe" />

Next, after thinking in user's shoes, following screens are required for the app.

##### Home

- Header with search box to search all games
- Different sections to show games group by trending, featured, latest and so on. Each section contains a carousel.
- Clicking on a game item takes user to Game details screen

##### Game detail

- Show the game name, author name, feature image, description, no. of people enrolled and start button

##### Countdown timer

- A game starts with a countdown timer starting from 5

##### Game question

- Countdown timer runs from 20 seconds
- Score is displayed
- Question image

##### Edit Game

#### React Native

React Native can be used to create both Android and iOS apps. Since I know React and JavaScript, I am planning to use React Native to develop this app. From tomorrow onwards, I have planned to go through [React Native course by Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-react-native-course). I do not know React Native and I am starting from scratch.

So far I spent **2.5 hours** on Soku.
