# Soku - The Guessing Game - Part 1

I am a JavaScript developer. I **do not know mobile app development**. But I wish to launch a guessing game in App store. I can spare **30 mins daily** for this project. Every day, I will log what I did. My goal is to generate **$2000 dollars monthly** from this app. Let us see what all I need to do.

### Day 1 - Jul 19, 2020

Today I spent thinking about this app. Then googled for a short name. Then searched play store for existing names.

#### The App

This game is named **Soku**, meaning _immediately_ in Japanese. The game is quick and I want a short name for the app. So it ended with Soku.

The inspiration came from a <a href="https://flipkart.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Flipkart</a> game, which I used to play everyday with 100% concentration :). That game's name is **Guess What**.

<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<Image src={imageGuessWhat} style={{maxWidth: "300px"}} alt="Guess What"/>
</div>

I am going to make it more generic. Users can create their own guessing game using Soku.
