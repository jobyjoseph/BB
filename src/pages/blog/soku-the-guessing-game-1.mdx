# Soku - The Guessing Game - Part 1

I am a JavaScript developer. I **do not know mobile app development**. But I wish to launch a guessing game in App store. I can spare **30 mins daily** for this project. Every day, I will log what I did. My goal is to generate **$2000 dollars monthly** from this app. Let us see what all I need to do.

### Day 1 - Jul 19, 2020

Today I spent thinking about this app. Then googled for a short name. Then searched play store for existing names.

#### The App

This game is named **Soku**, meaning _immediately_ in Japanese. The game is quick and I want a short name for the app. So it ended with Soku.

The inspiration came from a <a href="https://flipkart.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Flipkart</a> game, which I used to play everyday with 100% concentration :). That game's name is **Guess What**.

<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<Image src={imageGuessWhat} style={{maxWidth: "300px"}} alt="Guess What"/>
</div>

I am going to make it more generic. Users can create their own guessing game using Soku.

### Day 2 - Jul 20, 2020

Today it is holiday for me. So I am spending around 2 hours with the app. I designed a basic wireframe to start with using Adobe XD.

<Image src={imageSokuWireframe} alt="Soku Wireframe" />

Next, after thinking in user's shoes, following screens are required for the app.

##### Home

- Header with search box to search all games
- Different sections to show games group by trending, featured, latest and so on. Each section contains a carousel.
- Clicking on a game item takes user to Game details screen

##### Game detail

- Show the game name, author name, feature image, description, no. of people enrolled and start button

##### Countdown timer

- A game starts with a countdown timer starting from 5

##### Game question

- Game name is displayed
- Countdown timer runs from 20 seconds
- Score is displayed
- Question image
- Answer placeholder
- Jumbled buttons with characters
- Skip button
- Backspace button
- Submit button

##### Score
- Show Score
- Login button for rank
- List of top players

##### Edit Game
- Name of the game can be edited
- Link to view questions / edit them
- select questions and delete them
- delete a game

#### React Native

React Native can be used to create both Android and iOS apps. Since I know React and JavaScript, I am planning to use React Native to develop this app. From tomorrow onwards, I have planned to go through [React Native course by Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-react-native-course). I do not know React Native and I am starting from scratch.

So far I spent **2.5 hours** on Soku.

### Day 3 - Jul 21, 2020

I am currently going through [React Native course by Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-react-native-course). Today, I learned about:

- React Native setup in iOS, Android emulators
- Run app in a physical device using Expo
- Debugging techniques
- React Native APIs like Text, Images, Button, Touchables
- Installing hooks from React Native community

Total time: **3 hours**

### Day 4 - Jul 22, 2020

I am still going through React Native course by Mosh. Today, I learned about positioning and layouts. Being experienced with CSS flexbox, understanding layouts was easy.

I could also read few articles about best practices to be followed in a React Native project.

Total time: **3.5 hours**

### Day 5 - Jul 23, 2020

Today it was mainly handson. I prepared the welcome screen of the _DoneWithIt_ app. It is the project created as part of the course.

<Image src={imageDonewithitWelcome} style={{maxWidth: "300px", display: "block", margin: "auto"}} alt="Donewithit welcome screen" />

While creating the screen, I got comfortable with `ImageBackground`, `StyleSheet`, `Text`, `View`, `Image` components in React Native.

I got one hour wait time in kid's school today. I could read 2 good articles. One was on how to do image processing using Python, AWS lambda and OpenCV. The other one was on user authentication using AWS Cognito and React Native.

Total time: **5 hours**

### Day 6 - Jul 24, 2020

Today was a long day filled with office, hospital appointment, friday movie and visiting places. I was tired and the time is 3am. In order to somehow meet the 30 mins challenge, I continued with Mosh's video for 30 minutes. I created a _Image View _ screen.

<Image src={imageDonewithitImageView} style={{maxWidth: "300px", display: "block", margin: "auto"}} alt="Donewithit image view screen" />

As part of the course, I learned about `resizeMode` in `Image` tag.

Total time: **5.5 hours**

### Day 7 - Jul 25, 2020

I learned mainly about styling. Since the styling like padding, border, margin, font are almost similar like CSS, I could go through the videos pretty fast.

Total time: **6 hours**
