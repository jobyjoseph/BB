# Soku - The Guessing Game - Part 2

Part 2 contains the tasks did during the month of August 2020.

### Day 14 - Aug 1, 2020

Learned:

- Create a reusable Icon component.
- Used **Pull to Refresh** feature of FlatList

Total time: **9.5 hours**

### Day 15 - Aug 2, 2020

There are lot of work from my full time job. But, I am somehow finding 30 minutes time just for continuation. I started building the tutorial app's account screen. It is basically using the `ListItem` component I created earlier.


Total time: **10 hours**

### Day 16 - Aug 3, 2020

The account screen of _DoneWithIt_ app is completed. I am now comfortable in using `FlatList` component.

<Image src={imgDoneWithItAccountScreen} style={{maxWidth: "300px", display: "block", margin: "auto"}} alt="Donewithit Account screen" />


Total time: **10 hours**

### Day 17 - Aug 4, 2020

Today, I worked on the Listings Screen of _DoneWithIt_ app. I used the `<Card />` component created earlier. All the data is hard coded. I will be learning API requests in coming lessons.

<Image src={imgDoneWithItListingsScreen} style={{maxWidth: "300px", display: "block", margin: "auto"}} alt="Donewithit listings screen" />


Total time: **10.5 hours**

### Day 18 - Aug 5, 2020

A new section about input controls started in the course. Today, I learned how to use text input. I then created a custom text input component which can also show an icon on the left.

Total time: **11 hours**

### Day 19 - Aug 6, 2020

Today I worked on rest of the custom text input component. Then I learned how `Switch` control works.

Total time: **11.5 hours**
