# Hello World Next.js Site for Beginners

Next.js is now a popular framework built on top React. It handles several functionalities required for a web app, like routing, server side rendering and APIs. Having said that, how easy it is to create a simple website with 2 static pages? Let us see in this article.

## Node Version

We need **Node.js** to run a Next.js website. In order to run a site with php files, we need a PHP engine in our server. Only that engine can execute `.php` files and respond back HTML to the user. Just like that, Next.js framework executes JavaScript in the server. For that we need a JS engine which can parse and execute JavaScript in the server. And that is the role of Node.js.

We can check if Node.js is installed in our machine by typing following command in terminal.

```
node --version
```

If Node.js is installed, above command prints the installed version number in the terminal, like `v14.15.0`. The version number should be greater than `v10.13.0` to run Next.js.

If we do not have Node.js, we can download it from <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">nodejs.org</a> and install it.

> We can also install Node.js using <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm" target="_blank">NVM</a>. It allows to install multiple versions of Node.js in same machine. And whenever required, it is very easy to switch between the versions.
