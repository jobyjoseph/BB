# Next.js Interview Questions - getStaticProps, getStaticPaths, getServerSideProps

**Question:**

Why we use `getStaticProps`?

**Answer:**

Next.js can prerender pages. `getStaticProps` is a method in a Next.js page which is executed during build step. It can set the data ready for the actual page to prerender. It is mainly used to:

- Fetch data required for the page
- If the fetched data can be publicly accessed. That means, it can be stored in CDNs
- Pre-render pages for better SEO

**Question:**

In my ecommerce website, I have got a product details API to fetch product information. The API endpoint is `/products/:productid`. Here is a sample API response.

```javascript
{
  "name": "Brother Monochrome Laser Printer",
  "color": "Black"
}
```

The product details page HTML looks like below.

```html
<div>
  <h1>Product Name</h1>
  <h2>Color</h2>
</div>
```

How to use the API response in the HTML during pre-rendering?

**Answer:**

In order to populate the HTML with data during pre-rendering step, we need to use `getStaticProps`. For that we need to export an `async` function called `getStaticProps` from the page.

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {

  const response = await fetch("...");

  return {
    props: response,
  };
}
```
As the name suggests, `getStaticProps` function supply static props values required in the pre-rendering phase. Here `getStaticProps` supplies `name` and `color` to the component. So the next step is to consume the prop values in `products` component.

```javascript
function products(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.name}</h1>
      <h2>{props.color}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```
