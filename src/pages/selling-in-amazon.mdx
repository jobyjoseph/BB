# Selling in Amazon

## Selling Fee Structure

The fee rates varies based on the fulfillment channel we choose. As an Amazon seller, we can deliver items to customers in 3 ways.

1. Fulfillment By Amazon(FBA) : Amazon do all job. It stores, packs and delivers the product
2. Easy Ship : The seller stores and packs the product. Amazon delivers it.
3. Self-Ship : The seller does all the job, ie store, pack and ship.

### Benefits of FBA

- Focus more on business, since Amazon take care of storing, packing and delivering
- The products gets eligible for Amazon Prime
- Easy returns
- Scalability - As the sales increases, seller need not worry about proper delivery
- Easy handling of Cash on Delivery. Amazon collects cash, deposits in seller's bank account
- FBA seller is automatically a Prime seller

### How FBA works

- Seller sends his items to Amazon Fulfillment center or Amazon picks up from the seller
- Amazon stores the items
- Customers order the items, mostly through Prime
- Amazon packs and delivers the items from fulfillment center
- Amazon provides customer support for the items

One can know approximately how much profit can be made from the [profitability calculator](https://sellercentral.amazon.in/fba/profitabilitycalculator/index?lang=en_IN&ref=FBAPricingServicesPage&ld=NSGoogle)

Shipment and other costs for your item can also be calculated using this [cost calculator](https://services.amazon.in/services/sell-on-amazon/pricing.html?ref=as18_in_soa_ben_pricing#Calculator).

### How Easy-Ship works

In Easy-Ship, the item is picked from seller's location by Amazon Logistics Delivery Associate and delivered to the buyer.

Easy-Ship allows sellers to use **Pay on Delivery** service. Amazon collects cash and deposit in seller's bank account.

Sellers can buy Amazon packaging material to ship their products. Example: [Amazon Branded Prime Packaging Tape](https://www.amazon.in/Amazon-Branded-Prime-Packaging-Tape/dp/B07GT2T1G5), [DCG pac Amazon Branded Tape](https://www.amazon.in/Amazon-Branded-Tapes-mtr-Pack/dp/B01N2TH7VU), [Amazon.In Branded Corrugated Box](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B01680KGEA/ref=s9_acsd_otopr_hd_bw_bC2QnO3_c2_x_5_t?pf_rd_m=A1K21FY43GMZF8&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_r=QP1MPRACQAHNPS1X2DAP&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=e70311f5-3ba7-549d-8c8a-c215cbf834f8&pf_rd_i=11029533031)

### Cost for Easy-Ship

In Easy-Ship, Amazon only handles the shipping. Seller does storing and packing.

Our product is Kitchen tissues. We plan to sell it for Rs.249 in Amazon India. The cost to produce it is Rs.24. Tissues come under the category of Household Supplies. So the referral fee is 4%(Rs.10). Fixed closing fees is Rs.2. The tissue weight is approximately 600grams. So Amazon's cost to ship the product nationally is Rs.91.

So the amount the seller gets after Amazon costs =  249 - (10+2+91) = Rs.146

Seller's profit = 146 - 24 = Rs.122.

If we go with Amazon's FBA, the seller will have a loss of approximately Rs.17. If we have a small product in size, with high margin, go for FBA.
