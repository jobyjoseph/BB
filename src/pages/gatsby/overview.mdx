# Gatsby Overview

<a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
  Gatsby
</a> helps to start with a web project quickly. It is also easy to manage data in
a Gatsby project. Gatsby architecture is designed to handle distributed components.
It is easy to manage a decoupled API driven web application using Gatsby.

**This site is running on Gatsby and Netlify**

A web developer does not have to worry about different setup tools like Webpack, Babel, CDN and so on. We can easily install Gatsby and host it in any web server. Backbencher.dev is using Netlify as it is very easy to deploy the app directly from our Git server.

## Data Orchestration

Gatsby has the power to serve data from **multiple sources**. We do not have to worry about a single monolithic data source. Also the deployable Gatsby files are **pure static files** which can be hosted in any web servers or directly served from a CDN.

Such a feature helps Gatsby to serve multiple functionalities on a single platform. Like, it is easy to show a page in Gatsby with blog content from Wordpress and eCommerce content from Magento.

## Progressive Web App

Gatsby can output a Progressive Web App that gives a better and smooth experience especially in a mobile device.
