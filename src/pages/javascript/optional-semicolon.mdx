# Optional Semicolon

JavaScript uses semi-colon(`;`) to separate two statements.

```javascript
var a; let b;
```

In JavaScript, if we omit the semi-colon, JavaScript intelligently understands end of statements.

```javascript
var
a
=
6
console.log(a); // 6
```

In the above code JavaScript parser first takes `var` and then check if adding next phrase makes any sense. `var a` is a valid statement. The engine does not stop there. It will check if the next part can also be appended. `var a =` makes sense only if there is a value or expression after `=`. We have `6` which is valid value. Now, the statement looks like `var a = 6`. Again, JavaScript checks if appending next line makes sense. `var a = 6 console.log(a)` is not a valid statement. So JavaScript, automatically inserts a semi-colon after `6`. So our code after parsing looks like:

```javascript
var a = 6;
console.log(a);
```
