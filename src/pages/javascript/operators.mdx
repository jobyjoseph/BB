# Operators

Operators are characters or a group of characters which can perform certain operations in JavaScript. Example, `+` is a character which can be used to perform an addition in JavaScript.

The values on which the operator acts upon are called **operands**. Example, in case of an addition like `3 + 4`, `3` and `4` are operands.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic or numerical manipulations on the operands. Basic arithmetic operators are

1. Multiplication - `*`
2. Division - `/`
3. Modulo - `%`
4. Addition - `+`
5. Subtraction - `-`

## Binary and Unary Operators <a name="binary-unary-operators" />

In case of adding two numbers, the `+` operator requires two operands. Then only it can work. Such operators are called **Binary** operators.

Some operators like negation(`!`) requires only one operand. Example:

```javascript
!false  // true
```
Such operators are called **Unary** operators.

Binary and Unary are a way to classify all operators in JavaScript based on the number of operands required. Operators can also be grouped based on the operations they perform. Example: Conditional operators check if a particular condition is satisfied or not. Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations.



## typeof <a name="typeof" />

`typeof` is an unary operator in JavaScript. It returns the type of the operand supplied to it.

```javascript
console.log(typeof 42);   // "number"

var str = "Backbencher";
console.log(typeof str);  // "string"
```

> `typeof undefined` is `undefined` and `typeof null` is `object` instead of `null`. That is actually a bug in JavaScript implementation happened years ago.
