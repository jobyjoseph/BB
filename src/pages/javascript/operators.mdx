# Operators

Operators are characters or a group of characters which can perform certain operations in JavaScript. Example, `+` is a character which can be used to perform an addition in JavaScript.

The values on which the operator acts upon are called **operands**. Example, in case of an addition like `3 + 4`, `3` and `4` are operands.

## Binary and Unary Operator

In case of adding two numbers, the `+` operator requires two operands. Then only it can work. Such operators are called **Binary** operators.

Some operators like negation(`!`) requires only one operand. Example:

```javascript
!false  // true
```
Such operators are called **Unary** operators.

Binary and Unary are a way to classify all operators in JavaScript based on the number of operands required. Operators can also be grouped based on the operations they perform.
