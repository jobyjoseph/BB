# Operators

Operators are characters or a group of characters which can perform certain operations in JavaScript. Example, `+` is a character which can be used to perform an addition in JavaScript.

The values on which the operator acts upon are called **operands**. Example, in case of an addition like `3 + 4`, `3` and `4` are operands.

## Binary and Unary Operators <a name="binary-unary-operators" />

In case of adding two numbers, the `+` operator requires two operands. Then only it can work. Such operators are called **Binary** operators.

Some operators like negation(`!`) requires only one operand. Example:

```javascript
!false  // true
```
Such operators are called **Unary** operators.

Binary and Unary are a way to classify all operators in JavaScript based on the number of operands required. Operators can also be grouped based on the operations they perform. Example: Conditional operators check if a particular condition is satisfied or not. Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations.

## Optional Chaining(`?.`) <a name="optional-chaining" />

Let us take an example to understand this operator. Here is a JavaScript object.

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: "Backbencher",
  age: 34
}
```

Assume above object is returned from an API. The developer's assumption was the response contained a field for `address` also like below.

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: "Backbencher",
  age: 34,
  address: {
    city: "Kakkanad",
    pincode: 682030
  }
}
```

The developer tries to read the value of pincode using:

```javascript
const pincode = obj.address.pincode
```

Since the actual response does not have `address` property, `obj.address` is `undefined`. Trying to access `pincode` property of `undefined` throws error as show below.

```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'pincode' of undefined
```

To avoid this error developers write a chain of type check like:

```javascript
const pincode = obj && obj.address && obj.address.pincode;
```

Above code safely executes and assign `undefined` to `pincode`. But, as the depth of object increases, the code becomes unnecessarily lengthy.

**Optional Chaining** operator helps to do this undefined check easily. Here is how above pincode statement is written using optional chaining.

```javascript
const pincode = obj?.address?.pincode;
```

### Optional Chaining with function calls

Here is an object in JavaScript.

```javascript
const profile = {
  name: "Backbencher"
}
```

Assuming, there is a method `show()` in `profile` object, we are calling the method.

```javascript
profile.show();
```

Since `show()` method does not exist, above statement throws an error:

```
TypeError: profile.show is not a function
```

So here, we need to call a method **if only it exists**. In that case, we can ensure a valid method using `?.` and then call it.

```javascript
profile.show?.()
```

What if the `profile` object already contain a property `show` like below.

```javascript
const profile = {
  name: "Backbencher",
  show: 34
}
```

Here, even if we use optional chaining operator, we are trying to execute a number property `show` as a method. That results in `TypeError`.

```
TypeError: profile.show is not a function
```

## typeof <a name="typeof" />

`typeof` is an unary operator in JavaScript. It returns the type of the operand supplied to it.

```javascript
console.log(typeof 42);   // "number"

var str = "Backbencher";
console.log(typeof str);  // "string"
```

> `typeof undefined` is `undefined` and `typeof null` is `object` instead of `null`. That is actually a bug in JavaScript implementation happened years ago.
