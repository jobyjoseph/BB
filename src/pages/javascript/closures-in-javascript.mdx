# Closures in JavaScript

Closure is formed when a function remembers its lexical scope even when executed outside its lexical scope.

One of the easy way to meet this condition to form a closure, is when a function returns another function. That is why usually during interviews, when asked about closures, candidates say "When a function returns another function, that is a closure.".

Example of a closure.

```javascript{numberLines: true}
function a(){
  const name = "Backbencher";

  function b() {
    console.log(name);
  }

  return b;
}

const c = a();
c(); // "Backbencher"
```

Closure is when a function(`b()`) remembers its lexical scope(`name` is part of the scope) even when the function is executed outside(global scope) that lexical scope(scope of `a()`).

## Closure in setTimeout()

Consider the following code snippet:

```javascript
function a(name) {
  setTimeout(function(){
    console.log(name);
  }, 1000);
}

a("Backbencher.dev");
```

Is there a closure formed in above snippet? Yes. Here, the callback function passed to `setTimeout()` is defined in the scope of `setTimeout` function. But after 1 second, the callback function is executed by JavaScript engine in Global scope. Still, the function remebers its lexical scope and prints the value of `name`.

### setTimeout() in for loop

Here is another code using `setTimeout()`. Our aim is to print numbers 1 to 5 every second.

```javascript
for(var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function(){
    console.log(i);
  }, i * 1000);
}
```
Again the callback function of `setTimeout()` remembers the value of `i` even executed after some time. As mentioned above
But when we execute above code, the output is:

```
6
6
6
6
6
```

Why? Assume, JavaScript is storing all the callback functions in memory to be executed after 1 sec, 2 sec and so on.
When these functions finally run, it is trying to print the value of `i`. But there is no local variable `i` inside the function. So as per lexical scope rules, JavaScript search for a variable `i` outside, ie in the global scope. There it finds a variable `i` with value of 6(because the loop is now complete). That is the reason why 6 is printed 5 times.

What modification we can do to print 1 to 5? We need to create a wrap for each `setTimeout()` calls like below.

```javascript
for(var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  (function(j) {
    setTimeout(function(){
      console.log(j);
    }, i * 1000);
  }(i));
}
```

Here when each callback is executed, the value of `j` is resolved from the IIFE outside. We found a solution using ES5 way. There is a simpler solution using ES6. In ES6, we can declare block level scopes using `let` keyword.

```javascript
for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function(){
    console.log(i);
  }, i * 1000);
}
```

## Closures for Module Pattern

So what is a module? Module is piece of code that can hide some information and expose only what is required. Hiding the information is called **encapsulation**.

Here is a code which is _trying_ to be a module:

```javascript
var bank = {
  processingFee: 100,
  calculateTotalCost: function(amount) {
    return amount + this.processingFee
  }
}

console.log(bank.calculateTotalCost(2300)); // 2400
```

The above code failed as a module. If it was a module, it would have given access only to `calculateTotalCost()` function. But now, somebody who is not happy with the processing fees, can update it using:

```javascript
bank.processingFee = 0;
```

Now we got the problem. What we want is, there should be a way `calculateTotalCost()` can access `processingFee` and at the same time, no one else can access it. This can be achieved using closures. We can make `calculateTotalCost()` that function which remembers `processingFee`.

Here is how we do it.

```javascript
var bank = (function() {
  var processingFee = 100;
  return {
    calculateTotalCost: function(amount) {
      return amount + processingFee;
    }
  }
}());
```

And above code is an example of Module Pattern.
