# JS Daily #38 - Adding Two Boolean Values

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
console.log(true + true);
```

<Divider />

The output is `2`.

When both the operands for `+` is of type **Boolean**, both the operands are converted to numbers. `true` is converted to `1` and `false` is converted to `0`. That is why the result printed as `2`.
