# JavaScript Interview Questions - Asynchronous JavaScript

** Question: **

What is the output of following code? Also, please provide explanation for your answer.

```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log("First"), 0);
console.log("Second");
```

** Answer: **

In the console, first `"Second"` will be printed, then `"First"`.

```
"Second"
"First"
```

`setTimeout` works asynchronously. Even though the delay is 0 millisecond, in line 1, only the `setTimeout()` invocation is happening. That does not execute the callback function passed to `setTimeout`.

Then in the second line `"Second"` is printed. After that, the call stack is free to execute the callback function. So it executes and prints `"First"` in console.
