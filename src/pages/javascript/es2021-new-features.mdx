# ES2021 / ES12 New Features

ECMAScript 2021 version is expected to be released in the month of June 2021. Here are some of the features we can expect in ES2021 or ES12.

## String replaceAll() Method

Currently JavaScript string has a `replace()` method. It can be used to replace a string with another string.

```javascript
const str = "Backbencher sits at the Back";
const newStr = str.replace("Back", "Front");
console.log(newStr); // "Frontbencher sits at the Back"
```

`replace()` method only replaces the first occurrence, if the **pattern is a string**, in this case(`"Back"`).

We can do a full replacement if we supply the pattern as a **regular expression**.

```javascript
const str = "Backbencher sits at the Back";
const newStr = str.replace(/Back/g, "Front"); // highlight-line
console.log(newStr); // "Frontbencher sits at the Front"
```

`String.prototype.replaceAll()` is trying to bring the full replacement option when the pattern is a string.
