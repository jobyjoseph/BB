# JS Daily #23 - Function Apply() Method on Objects

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const obj = {
  a : function(){
    console.log(this.b);
  }
}

obj.a.apply({b : 10});
```

<Divider />

The output is `10`.

`apply()` is a method of function object. Even though `a` is called in the context of `obj`, the invocation context is overridden by `apply()` method. Therefore, when `obj.a()` is invoked, `this` has the value of `{b : 10}` which is set by `apply()` method. That is why `10` is printed in the console.
