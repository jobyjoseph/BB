# Character Set

JavaScript programs are written using **Unicode** character set. Unicode is a superset of ASCII and supports most of languages in the world.

> Unicode is a standard for consistent representation of text maintained by Unicode Consortium. Unicode Consortium is a non-profit organization based in Mountain View California.

## Non English Text

Let us try to print a Japanese text using `console.log()` statement. I translated `"hope"` to Japanese using Google translate and it says the Japanese is `Nozomu`.

```javascript
console.log("望む");
```

Above code prints the Japanese text just like that in console.

```
望む
```

Since JavaScript supports Unicode character set, it also possible to use foreign languages as **variable names**.

```javascript
const പേര് = "Backbencher";
console.log(പേര്); // "Backbencher"
```

Above code used a word from Malayalam language as an identifier. That is also valid in JavaScript.
