# Optional Chaining

Optional Chaining operator is `?.`.

When trying to read the value of a deeply nested property of an object, there is a high chance a JavaScript developer might have faced below error.

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'pincode' of undefined
```

As an example, What happens is, we thought there will be a property `address` in the API response. Assuming `address` is already there, we try to access `pincode` property of `address` like:

```javascript
response.address.pincode
```

Current solution to avoid such problem is checking for `undefined` before digging deep in the property chain.

```javascript
response.address && response.address.pincode
```

Optional Chaining saves a lot of code in that respect. With the help of Optional Chaining, we can modify the code to:

```javascript
response.address?.pincode
```

This will return `undefined` safely if `address` and there by `pincode` property is not there. If value is present, it will return the original value.

## Optional Chaining with function calls

We need to call a method if it exists. In that case, we can ensure a valid method using `?.` and then call it.

```javascript
profile.show?.()
```

If `show` is a property and not a method, above code will throw `TypeError`.

There are few more capabilities for Optional Chaining which you can read [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) in MDN.
