# JavaScript Basic Interview Questions

** Question: **

How are functions stored in memory by JavaScript? Here we have a function `sum()`.

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

How `sum()` function is stored in memory?

** Answer: **

JavaScript allocates a memory block, just like a memory is allocated for a variable. The definition of the function is then stored inside the variable. That is why if we print the value of `sum` in console, it prints out the full source code of the function.

```javascript
console.log(sum);
```

Here is the console output:
<Image src={imageFnConsole} style={{maxWidth: "200px", display: "block", margin: "auto"}} alt="Printing function in console" />

** Question: **

Is JavaScript single threaded or multi-threaded?

** Answer: **

JavaScript is single threaded. That means, it can execute one and only one part of the code at a time. If a code block calls a function, the block needs to wait until the function finishes its execution.
