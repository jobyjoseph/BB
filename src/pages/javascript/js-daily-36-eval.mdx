# JS Daily #36 - Eval

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
var b = 20;
eval('var b = 10');
console.log(b);
```

<Divider />

The output is `10`.

`eval()` evaluates the passed argument string as an expression. Here, the expression is changing the value of `b` from 20 to 10. That is why the output prints `10`.

Since `eval()` can dynamically change the scope and flow of code, it is advised NOT to use it whenever possible.
