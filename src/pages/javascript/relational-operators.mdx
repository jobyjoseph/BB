# Relational Operators

Relational operators test for a relationship such as equal to, less than and so on. Relational operators return `true` or `false` depending on whether the relationship exists.

```javascript
console.log( 2 < 3 ); // true
```

## Equality and Inequality Operators

### Equality(==)

Equality(`==`) operator checks if two values are same. The two operands can be of **any type**. If two operands are of different types, JavaScript converts both operands to same type and performs the equality check. Let us understand how `==` operator performs comparison.

If both operands are of same type and if their values are same, then equality(`==`) operator returns `true`.

If both operands are of different types, equality(`==`) operator applies a set of rules to determine equality.

If one value is `null` and other `undefined`, they are equal.

```javascript
console.log(null == undefined); // true
```

If one value is number and other one a string, the string value is converted to number and then the comparison is performed.

```javascript
console.log(3 == "3"); // true
```
