# Relational Operators

Relational operators test for a relationship such as equal to, less than and so on. Relational operators return `true` or `false` depending on whether the relationship exists.

```javascript
console.log( 2 < 3 ); // true
```

## Equality and Inequality Operators

### Equality(==)

Equality(`==`) operator checks if two values are same. The two operands can be of any type. If two operands are of different types, JavaScript converts both operands to same type and performs the equality check.
