# Variables

Variables are named memory locations. When we declare a variable in JavaScript, it means that a memory location is allocated to store some value and that location can be accessed using the variable name.

Here is an example of variable declaration.

```javascript
var name;
```

Here `name` is pointing towards some memory location in RAM. We store some value to that memory location using assignment operator(`=`).

```javascript
name = "Backbencher";
```

## Array Variables

In JavaScript, we can define arrays by placing comma separated values inside a square brackets(`[]`). When we assign an array to a variable, JavaScript allocates contiguous memory locations to store each elements of the array.

```javascript
var fruits = ["Apple", "Banana"];
```

Here `fruits` represent the set of contiguous memory locations allocated. Later, we access the values of the array by giving the element index.

```javascript
console.log(fruits[1]); // "Banana"
```

## Variable Only Operators

There are some operators in JavaScript that can be used only with a variable. One example is unary `++` operator. It increments the value present in a variable by 1 and reassign the new value back to the variable.

```javascript
var a = 5;

a++;

console.log(a); // 6
```

Similar to `++` operator there is a `--` operator. It decrements the variable value by 1.

If we try to use `++` operator directly with a value, it throws an error.

```javascript
console.log(2++); // SyntaxError: Invalid left-hand side expression in postfix operation
```
