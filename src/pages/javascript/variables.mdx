# Variables

Variables are **named memory locations**. When we declare a variable in JavaScript, it means that a memory location is allocated to store some value and that location can be accessed using the variable name.

Here is an example of variable declaration.

```javascript
var name;
```

Here `name` is pointing towards some memory location in RAM. One of the way to store some value to that memory location is by using assignment operator(`=`).

```javascript
name = "Backbencher";
```

## Variable Declaration

In JavaScript, a variable can be declared using any one of the following keywords.

1. `var`
2. `let`
3. `const`

### var

`var` can declare either **global scoped** or **function scoped** variables.

```javascript
var a;

function baz() {
  var b;
}
```

Variable `a` is declared outside of all functions. Hence, `a` is in global scope. Variable `b` is declared inside a function `baz()`. Hence, `b` is in function scope, ie the scope of `baz()`. The variable `b` can be used only inside the function `baz()`.

#### Default value

Default value of a variable declared using `var` is `undefined`.

```javascript
var a;
console.log(a); // undefined
```

#### Variable redeclaration

A variable declared using `var` can be redeclared. It **does not throw any error even in strict mode**.

```javascript{numberLines: true}
var a = 3;
var a = 5;
console.log(a); // 5
```

JavaScript engine is keeping a track of all variables declared. So in line 2, instead of redeclaring `a`, the engine maps to the memory location created in line 1. In that case, what is the output of below code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
var a = 3;
var a;
console.log(a);
```

If you expected `undefined`, it is wrong. The output is `3`. Here also in line 2, it is a redeclaration of variable `a`. JavaScript engine skips that. Since there is no assignment in line 2, previous value(`3`) is retained.

#### Hoisting

Variables declared using `var` are created before executing any code. Before interpreting JavaScript code line by line, JavaScript engine parses through the full code. During this parsing step, the engine allocates memory to variables declared using `var` and assign `undefined`. This behaviour is called **hoisting** of variables.

```javascript{numberLines: true}
console.log(a); // undefined
var a;
```

Here, line 1 is trying to print the value of `a`. But the variable `a` is declared only in line 2. Due to hoisting, when JavaScript engine executes line 1, variable `a` is already created. That is why above code outputs `undefined`.

Since the memory is allocated during parsing step, for a developer it seems like JavaScript is hoisting or moving the variable declaration to the top of current scope, before execution. For example, the JavaScript code we write looks like below.

```javascript
console.log(a);
var a;
console.log(b);
var b;
console.log(c);
var c;
```

After parsing step, the code looks like below for the JavaScript engine.

```javascript
var a;
var b;
var c;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
```

This can be the reason why this behaviour is called _hoisting_ like in flag hoisting.

During the hoisting process, only the memory allocation is done. Assigning values to the memory location happens only during execution. In that context, what will be the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 6;
```

Above code prints `undefined` as output. It is because, the value `6` is assigned to the variable only when the JavaScript engine reaches line 2. Till that time the value of `a` is `undefined`.


## Array Variables

In JavaScript, we can define arrays by placing comma separated values inside a square brackets(`[]`). When we assign an array to a variable, JavaScript allocates contiguous memory locations to store each elements of the array.

```javascript
var fruits = ["Apple", "Banana"];
```

Here `fruits` represent the set of contiguous memory locations allocated. Later, we access the values of the array by giving the element index.

```javascript
console.log(fruits[1]); // "Banana"
```

## Type of variables

In JavaScript, the type of a variable is decided by the type of value it holds. We can use `typeof` operator to find the type of a variable.

```javascript
var a = "Backbencher";
console.log(typeof a); // "string"

a = 2020;
console.log(typeof a); // "number"
```

In the example above, the variable name is same. But its type changed based on the assigned value.

## Variable Only Operators

There are some operators in JavaScript that can be used only with a variable. One example is unary `++` operator. It increments the value present in a variable by 1 and reassign the new value back to the variable.

```javascript
var a = 5;

a++;

console.log(a); // 6
```

Similar to `++` operator there is a `--` operator. It decrements the variable value by 1.

If we try to use `++` operator directly with a value, it throws an error.

```javascript
console.log(2++); // SyntaxError: Invalid left-hand side expression in postfix operation
```
