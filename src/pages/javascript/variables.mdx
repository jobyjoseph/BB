# Variables

Variables are **named memory locations**. When we declare a variable in JavaScript, it means that a memory location is allocated to store some value and that location can be accessed using the variable name.

Here is an example of variable declaration.

```javascript
var name;
```

Here `name` is pointing towards some memory location in RAM. One of the way to store some value to that memory location is by using assignment operator(`=`).

```javascript
name = "Backbencher";
```

## Variable Declaration

In JavaScript, a variable can be declared using any one of the following keywords.

1. `var`
2. `let`
3. `const`

### var

`var` can declare either **global scoped** or **function scoped** variables.

```javascript
var a;

function baz() {
  var b;
}
```

Variable `a` is declared outside of all functions. Hence, `a` is in global scope. Variable `b` is declared inside a function `baz()`. Hence, `b` is in function scope, ie the scope of `baz()`. The variable `b` can be used only inside the function `baz()`.

#### Default value

Default value of a variable declared using `var` is `undefined`.

```javascript
var a;
console.log(a); // undefined
```

#### Variable redeclaration

A variable declared using `var` can be redeclared.

```javascript{numberLines: true}
var a = 3;
var a = 5;
console.log(a); // 5
```

JavaScript engine is keeping a track of all variables declared. So in line 2, instead of redeclaring `a`, the engine maps to the memory location created in line 1.



## Array Variables

In JavaScript, we can define arrays by placing comma separated values inside a square brackets(`[]`). When we assign an array to a variable, JavaScript allocates contiguous memory locations to store each elements of the array.

```javascript
var fruits = ["Apple", "Banana"];
```

Here `fruits` represent the set of contiguous memory locations allocated. Later, we access the values of the array by giving the element index.

```javascript
console.log(fruits[1]); // "Banana"
```

## Type of variables

In JavaScript, the type of a variable is decided by the type of value it holds. We can use `typeof` operator to find the type of a variable.

```javascript
var a = "Backbencher";
console.log(typeof a); // "string"

a = 2020;
console.log(typeof a); // "number"
```

In the example above, the variable name is same. But its type changed based on the assigned value.

## Variable Only Operators

There are some operators in JavaScript that can be used only with a variable. One example is unary `++` operator. It increments the value present in a variable by 1 and reassign the new value back to the variable.

```javascript
var a = 5;

a++;

console.log(a); // 6
```

Similar to `++` operator there is a `--` operator. It decrements the variable value by 1.

If we try to use `++` operator directly with a value, it throws an error.

```javascript
console.log(2++); // SyntaxError: Invalid left-hand side expression in postfix operation
```
