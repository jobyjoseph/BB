# JS Daily #35 - Automatic Semicolon Insertion

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const a = 10
const b = a
(() => console.log(b))()
```

<Divider />

The output is:

```
TypeError: a is not a function
```

If you thought the output as `10`, then it is wrong. It would have been 10, if we explicitly placed semicolon at the end of each line.

```javascript
const a = 10;
const b = a;
(() => console.log(b))(); // 10
```

When JavaScript tries to automatically insert semi-colon, it follows a process. It take each segment of the code and join them, till a valid expression is formed.

Here the code in line 1 is

```
const a = 10
```

JavaScript then tries to place next word next to `10`, like

```
const a = 10const
```

Above combination is not valid according to JavaScript rules. So, it automatically inserts a semicolon after 10. Now let us see how it looks when JavaScript tries to attach line 3 at the end of line 2. It looks like this:

```
const b = a(() => console.log(b))()
```

Above statement looks valid for JS engine. It tries to execute `a` as a function. That is why, it results in _TypeError_.
