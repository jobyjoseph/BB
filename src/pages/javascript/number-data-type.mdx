# Number Data Type

In most of the programming languages, integer values and floating-point(numbers with decimal) values are treated differently. The amount of memory used for both types also varies. But in JavaScript, there is __no distinction__ between integer values and floating-point values.

## Memory and Range

In JavaScript, both integer and floating-point values are treated in the same way. Therefore, considering the worst case, the memory allocation for a number type should consider floating-point values. Each number in JavaScript occupies __64 bit__ of memory. The numbers are stored in _Double-precision floating-point_ format as per [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) standard.

In case of integers, JavaScript can accurately represent all integers between -9007199254740992(-2<sup>53</sup>) and 9007199254740992(2<sup>53</sup>), inclusive. Beyond this range, the precision might lose. Let us try adding one to the maximum range.

```javascript
console.log(9007199254740992+1); // 9007199254740992
```

The expected output is 9007199254740993. But the actual output is 9007199254740992.

## Numeric literal

When a number appears directly in a program, it is called a _numeric literal_. JavaScript supports numeric literals in several formats.

```javascript
12      // Base 10 integer literal
0xFF    // Base 16 integer literal
0377    // Base 8 integer literal
3.14    // Floating-Point literal
6.73e5  // Floating-Point literal
```
