# Number Data Type

In most of the programming languages, integer values and floating-point(numbers with decimal) values are treated differently. The amount of memory used for both types also varies. But in JavaScript, there is __no distinction__ between integer values and floating-point values.

## Memory and Range

In JavaScript, both integer and floating-point values are treated in the same way. Therefore, considering the worst case, the memory allocation for a number type should consider floating-point values. Each number in JavaScript occupies __64 bit__ of memory.
