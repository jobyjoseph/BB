# Unary Arithmetic Operators

As the name indicates, **unary** operators work on a single operand.

```javascript
-23
```

The four unary arithmetic operators are:

1. `+`
2. `-`
3. `++`
4. `--`

`+` and `-` can be used as binary operators also. All 4 unary arithmetic operators convert their non-numeric operands to a number or `NaN`.

## Unary Plus

The unary plus(`+`) operator converts its operand to a number or `NaN` and returns that converted value. When used with an operand that is already a number, it does not do anything.

```javascript
console.log(+"3.14"); // 3.14
console.log(+"3.14abc"); // NaN
console.log(+"abc");  // NaN
console.log(+true);   // 1
console.log(+false);  // 0
console.log(+null);   // 0
console.log(+undefined); // NaN
console.log(+{}); // NaN
```

So unary `+` operator can be used to convert a data type to its number equivalent. Note that, `null` is converted to `0` and `undefined` is converted to `NaN`.

## Unary Minus

When minus(`-`) is used as an unary operator, it first converts the operand to a number if required, then changes the sign of the number.

```javascript
console.log(-2); // -2
console.log(-(-3)); // 3
```

## Increment

The increment(`++`) operator increments(adds 1) to its single operand. The operand should be either a **variable**, an **element of an array** or a **property of an object**.

When `++` is used before the operand, it is called **pre-increment** operation. Here the increment expression increments the operand and returns the **incremented** value.

```javascript
var a = 1;
console.log(++a); // 2
```

When `++` is used after the operand, it is called **post-increment** operation. Here the increment expression increments the operand and returns the **unincremented** value.

```javascript
var a = 1;
console.log(a++); // 1
```

`++a` is not always equal to `a=a+1`. If the value of `a` is a string `"2"`, `++a` results in `3` and `a=a+1` results in `"21"`. This is because `++` works only with numbers and converts its operand to number.

## Associativity

Unary operators in JavaScript have **right associativity**.

```javascript
var a = 6;
var b = 2;
b
++
a;
console.log(a); // 7
console.log(b); // 2
```

Above code applied `++` to `a` due to right associativity.
