# Unary Arithmetic Operators

As the name indicates, **unary** operators work on a single operand.

```javascript
-23
```

The four unary arithmetic operators are:

1. `+`
2. `-`
3. `++`
4. `--`

`+` and `-` can be used as binary operators also. All 4 unary arithmetic operators convert their non-numeric operands to a number or `NaN`.


## Associativity

Unary operators in JavaScript have **right associativity**.

```javascript
var a = 6;
var b = 2;
b
++
a;
console.log(a); // 7
console.log(b); // 2
```

Above code applied `++` to `a` due to right associativity.
