# JS Daily #5 - Boolean Value With Nullish Coalescing Operator

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const a = false;
const result = a ?? "Hello";
console.log(result);
```

<Divider />

Output is `false`.

The nullish coalescing operator (`??`) is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is `null` or `undefined`, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand.

Default tendency is to return `"Hello"` because `a` is `false`. But `??` is explicitly built for `null` or `undefined`.
