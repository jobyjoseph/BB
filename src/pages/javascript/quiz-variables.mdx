# Quiz: Variables
<QuestionItem>

<Question>

**Question 1:**

What is the output?

```javascript
var a;
console.log(a);
```

</Question>

<Option>

`Reference Error: a is not defined`

</Option>
<Option isAnswer="yes">

`undefined`

</Option>
<Option>

`0`

</Option>
<Option>

`""`

</Option>

<Explanation>

**Explanation:** <br/> `a` is a variable that is declared in JavaScript using `var` keyword. Any variable that is declared is set with `undefined` value by default.

**Question 3:**

What is the output?

```javascript
const a;
console.log(a);
```

</Question>

<Option isAnswer="yes">

`SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration`

</Option>
<Option>

`undefined`

</Option>
<Option>

`SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier`

</Option>
<Option>

`""`

</Option>

<Explanation>

**Explanation:** <br/>
`const` keyword is used to declare a constant variable in JavaScript. The value initialized to a constant variable cannot be changed later. For the same reason, a constant variable should be initialized at the time of declaration itself. Otherwise, a syntax error is thrown.

**Question 4:**

What is the output?

```javascript
var a = 10;

{
  var a = 20;
}

console.log(a);
```

</Question>

<Option>

`undefined`

</Option>
<Option>

`SyntaxError: a is already registered`

</Option>
<Option isAnswer="yes">

`20`

</Option>
<Option>

`10`

</Option>

<Explanation>

**Explanation:** <br/>
A variable declared using `var` is either in global scope or in function scope. Here, both `a`'s are in global scope. And also, redeclaring a `var` variable using `var` is allowed. So the last assignment of 20 is the final value stored in variable `a`.

**Question 5:**

What is the output?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
var a = 3;
var a;
console.log(a);
```

</Question>

<Option isAnswer="yes">

`3`

</Option>
<Option>

`undefined`

</Option>
<Option>

`null`

</Option>
<Option>

`""`

</Option>

<Explanation>

**Explanation:** <br/>
JavaScript executes the code, line by line. Before executing the code, JavaScript engine parses the code to identify the scope, allocate memory, catch syntax errors and so on.

During this parsing step, line 1 results in a memory allocation for variable `a`. The assignment of 3 does not happen during parsing. That is part of second step, that is execution. When line 2 is parsed, again a variable with name `a` needs to be created. Since it is already created, the parser does nothing and move on. So finally, after the parsing step, JavaScript engine optimizes the code without line 2.

```javascript
var a = 3;
console.log(a);
```

That is why the output is 3.

**Question 6:**

What is the output?

```javascript
var a;
let a;
console.log(a);

</Question>

<Option>

`""`

</Option>
<Option>

`0`

</Option>
<Option>

`undefined`

</Option>
<Option isAnswer="yes">

`SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared`

</Option>

<Explanation>

**Explanation:** <br/>
`let` and `const` are two new keywords introduced in ES6. They are used to declare new variables. Both `let` and `const` throw `SyntaxError` if the variable is already declared either using `var`, `let` or `const`.

**Question 7:**

What is the output?

```javascript
console.log(a);
var a = 6;
```

</Question>

<Option isAnswer="yes">

`undefined`

</Option>
<Option>

`ReferenceError: a is not defined`

</Option>
<Option>

`6`

</Option>
<Option>

None of these

</Option>

<Explanation>

**Explanation:** <br/>
The variable `a` can be used before its declaration. This is called hoisting. But how it is possible? Why `undefined`, not `6`? To understand this, we need to know how JavaScript engine executes our code.

JavaScript is an interpreted language. It executes code line by line. But before starting the line-by-line execution, JavaScript parses through the code. During the parsing step, for each variable declaration, it allocates a memory location. Only, memory allocation happens during the parsing step, and the initialization happens during actual code execution.

In our code sample, when the first line tries to get the value of `a`, it can see that already a variable with `a` is allocated during parsing step. That is why it prints the value `undefined`. Only when the execution reaches line 2, the value of `6` is assigned.
