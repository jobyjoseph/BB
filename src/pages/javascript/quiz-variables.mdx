**Question 3:**

What is the output?

```javascript
const a;
console.log(a);
```

</Question>

<Option isAnswer="yes">

`SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration`

</Option>
<Option>

`undefined`

</Option>
<Option>

`SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier`

</Option>
<Option>

`""`

</Option>

<Explanation>

**Explanation:** <br/>
`const` keyword is used to declare a constant variable in JavaScript. The value initialized to a constant variable cannot be changed later. For the same reason, a constant variable should be initialized at the time of declaration itself. Otherwise, a syntax error is thrown.

**Question 4:**

What is the output?

```javascript
var a = 10;

{
  var a = 20;
}

console.log(a);
```

</Question>

<Option>

`undefined`

</Option>
<Option>

`SyntaxError: a is already registered`

</Option>
<Option isAnswer="yes">

`20`

</Option>
<Option>

`10`

</Option>

<Explanation>

**Explanation:** <br/>
A variable declared using `var` is either in global scope or in function scope. Here, both `a`'s are in global scope. And also, redeclaring a `var` variable using `var` is allowed. So the last assignment of 20 is the final value stored in variable `a`.

**Question 5:**

What is the output?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
var a = 3;
var a;
console.log(a);
```

</Question>

<Option isAnswer="yes">

`3`

</Option>
<Option>

`undefined`

</Option>
<Option>

`null`

</Option>
<Option>

`""`

</Option>

<Explanation>

**Explanation:** <br/>
JavaScript executes the code, line by line. Before executing the code, JavaScript engine parses the code to identify the scope, allocate memory, catch syntax errors and so on.

During this parsing step, line 1 results in a memory allocation for variable `a`. The assignment of 3 does not happen during parsing. That is part of second step, that is execution. When line 2 is parsed, again a variable with name `a` needs to be created. Since it is already created, the parser does nothing and move on. So finally, after the parsing step, JavaScript engine optimizes the code without line 2.

```javascript
var a = 3;
console.log(a);
```

That is why the output is 3.
