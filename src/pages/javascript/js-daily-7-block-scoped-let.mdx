# JS Daily #7 - Block Scoped Let

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
var a = 10;
{
  let a = 20;
}
console.log(a);
```

<Divider />

Output is **10**.

First a variable `a` is declared in global scope using `var` and initialized with value `10`. Then, a new block scoped variable `a` is declared using `let` and assigned with value `20`. The block scoped variable works only within the block(ie inside the curly brackets`{}`).
So, again outside the block, the printed `a` is the global `a` with value `10`.
