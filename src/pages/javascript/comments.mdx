# Comments

Comments in JavaScript improve readability of the code. A comment block is not executed by JavaScript engine. In JavaScript, we can write comments using two techniques.

## Single Line Comment

If the comment can be contained in one line, we can use `//` notation to write the comment. Here, the start of the comment is from `//` and the end is at the end of line.

```javascript
// First line of comment
console.log("Hello"); // Comment beside the code
```

## Multi Line Comment

When the comment text spans multiple lines, we can use `/* ... */` to write the comment.

```javascript
/*
Here is a comment that
takes more than one line.
*/
```

Multi line comment cannot be nested. Let us see what happens if we nest it.

```javascript
/*
Parent comment line
/*
Child comment line
*/
*/
```

Above code will throw an error. Because the first `*/` closes the entire comment text so far. So the second `*/` does not have a role and is the reason for syntax error.
