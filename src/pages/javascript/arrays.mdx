# Arrays

Arrays in JavaScript represent a **list of values**. The values can be **any valid data type** in JavaScript. Here is an example of array with elements, that are of different data types.

```javascript
[23, "Backbencher", true, 89.65]
```

## Array Literal

Array Literal is a list of zero or more expressions, each of which represents an array element, wrapped in square brackets(`[]`).

```javascript
["Apple", 23, true, {}]
```

### Skip Elements

While creating an array literal, elements can be skipped using commas. The skipped locations are filled by `undefined`.

```javascript
const arr = [2,,,3];
console.log(arr); // [2, undefined, undefined, 3]
```

### Trailing Comma

Trailing comma in an array is ignored. It does NOT create an `undefined` element at the last.

```javascript
const arr = [2, 4, 6,];
console.log(arr); // [2, 4, 6]
```
Trailing commas can create errors in older browsers. So it is better not to use it.

In order to improve the readability of code, explicitly put `undefined` in place of skipped elements.

**Question:**

What is the length of following array?

```javascript
[,,,]
```

<Answer>

The length of the array is **3**.

Here the array evaluates to `[undefined, undefined, undefined]`

## Array Declaration

There are multiple ways in which we can declare an array in JavaScript.

### Square Brackets(`[]`)

An array in JavaScript can be declared using square brackets(`[]`). All the list items are wrapped inside a pair of square bracket.

```javascript
const arr = [2, 4, 6];
```

#### Empty array

An array without any element is called an empty array. An empty array is declared using an empty pair of square bracket.

```javascript
const arr = [];
```

### Array() Constructor

An array in JavaScript can also be declared using `Array()` constructor. The arguments passed as input to the constructor forms the array elements.

```javascript
const arr = new Array("Apple", "Orange");
console.log(arr); // ["Apple", "Orange"];
```

#### Single number argument

When we pass a single number as argument to `Array()`, it treats the number as **array length**.

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const arr = new Array(2);
console.log(arr.length); // 2
console.log(arr); // [undefined, undefined]
```

Here line 3 prints an array with 2 elements. Note that it did not create an array `[2]`, with number 2 as its element.

If the single argument passed to the `Array()` constructor is a non-number, that argument is taken as an array element.

```javascript
const arr = new Array("Backbencher");
console.log(arr); // ["Backbencher"]
```

#### Empty array

An empty array is created using `Array()` constructor by not passing any arguments.

```javascript
const arr = new Array();
console.log(arr); // []
```

### Array() Function

`Array()` is an overloaded function in JavaScript. It works both as a function and constructor. All things which can be done using `Array()` constructor can be implemented using `Array()` function.

```javascript
const arr = Array("Apple", "Orange");
console.log(arr); // ["Apple", "Orange"];
```

#### Single number argument

When we pass a single number as argument to `Array()` function, it treats the number as **array length**.

```javascript
const arr = Array(2);
console.log(arr.length); // 2
console.log(arr); // [undefined, undefined]
```

#### Empty array

An empty array is created using `Array()` function by not passing any arguments.

```javascript
const arr = Array();
console.log(arr); // []
```

## Memory Allocation

Normally in a programming language, arrays allocate a contigous block of memory with fixed length. But in JavaScript, arrays are **just Object types** with special constructor and methods. So internally, JavaScript engine cannot go with contigous memory approach for arrays. It treats an array like an object(hash) internally.

#### Dynamic nature of arrays

JavaScript approach of handling arrays as objects is required to handle dynamic nature of arrays. In JavaScript, we can keep on adding elements to an existing array using `push()` method.

```javascript
const arr = [];
arr.push("Backbencher");
arr.push("JavaScript");
console.log(arr); // ["Backbencher", "JavaScript"]
```

Different data types in JavaScript like Boolean, Number, String and so on, occupy different memory sizes. In JavaScript, it is possible to update an element of an array to different data type.

```javascript
const arr = ["Backbencher", "JavaScript"];
arr[1] = 72;
console.log(arr); // ["Backbencher", 72]
```

Here, the second element of the array is changed from a string type to number type. If arrays are storing elements in contigous memory locations, then we need to shift elements in memory when the data type changes. But since arrays are internally treated as objects, it is easy to make data type changes in an array.

#### Array declaration

When declaring an array using `Array()` constructor function, we can specify the size of the array.

```javascript
const arr = new Array(1000);
```

When JavaScript engine executes above line of code, is it allocating 1000 memory locations? **No**. JavaScript cannot do that because it does not know what type of values are going to be in the array. JavaScript is actually creating an `Array` object and setting the `length` property of that object to `1000`.

> Every array(instance of `Array()`) has a property `length` which indicates the size of the array.

> One of the easy way to delete all elements of an array is to set the `length` property of the array to `0`.

#### Sparse arrays

Arrays in JavaScript are sparse. That means, we can create an array with non-contigous elements.

```javascript
const arr = [];
arr[1] = "First element";
arr[5] = "Second element";
```

When JavaScript engine executes above code, it creates an array object with two keys, `1` and `5` and corresponding values are stored. Sparse array approach in JavaScript saves memory usage, since it allocates memory only for elements that have data.

What if we try to print the value of `arr[3]`? It prints `undefined`. That is not because JavaScript is filling all gaps with `undefined`. It is because JavaScript is designed to return `undefined` when we access a non-existent property of an object.

In the above code snippet, when we assign a value to index 5, JavaScript automatically sets the value of `arr.length` to 6. That means, JavaScript always sets the `length` property value greater than the largest index value of the array.

## Array Instance Methods

### flat() <Version number="10"/>

The `flat()` method of an array flattens the array and **returns a new array**.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, ["A", "B"]];
console.log(arr.flat()); // [1, 2, "A", "B"]
```

#### Depth

`flat()` method accepts an optional parameter for depth. Depth specifies the extend to which the array can be flattened.

Here is an array with nested arrays and is 2 level deep.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, ["A", "B", ["C", "D"]]];
console.log(arr.flat(1)); // [1, 2, "A", "B", ["C", "D"]]
console.log(arr.flat(2)); // [1, 2, "A", "B", "C", "D"]
```

Depth value of 1 did not flatten the innermost sub-array. Depth value of 2 flattened all levels.

#### Default depth

The default value of depth parameter is `1`.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, ["A", "B", ["C", "D"]]];
console.log(arr.flat()); // [1, 2, "A", "B", ["C", "D"]]
```

#### Complete flatten

Passing `Infinity` as depth in `flat()` method flattens an array completely, irrespective of its nesting.

```javascript
const arr = ["A", ["B", ["C", ["D", ["E"]]]]];
console.log(arr.flat(Infinity)); // ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"]
```

#### Array holes

`flat()` method skips array holes.

```javascript
const arr = ["A", , "B"];
console.log(arr.flat()); // ["A", "B"]
```

### flatMap() <Version number="10" />

`flatMap()` is a combination of 2 array methods, `map()` and `flat()`. First, the mapping function is executed on the elements of the array. Then, flattening of the array is done of depth `1`. `flatMap()` returns a **new array**.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, [3, 4]];

// All number elements are made 0
const result = arr.flatMap(ele => {
  if(typeof ele === "number") {
    return ele * 0;
  }
  return ele;
});

console.log(result); // [0, 0, 3, 4]
```

Here, the output of the `map()` method will be:

```javascript
[0, 0, [3, 4]]
```

On the result, `flat()` method is applied to get:

```javascript
[0, 0, 3, 4]
```
