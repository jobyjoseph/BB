# JS Daily #26 - Object Copy By Reference

What is the output of following code?

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const obj1 = {
  a : "Apple",
  showA : function() {
    console.log(this.a);
  }
}

const obj2 = obj1;

obj2.a = "Banana";

obj1.showA();
```

<Divider />

The output is `"Banana"`.

In line1, an object is created and assigned to variable `obj1`. Note that, I did not say "we created an object `obj1`". It is because, ideally what is happening is that, at first, JavaScript engine creates the object on the right hand side somewhere in the memory. It then stores the **reference** of that object in variable `obj1`.

Next in line 8, when we copy `obj1` to `obj2`, only the reference to the object is copied. That is why, in line 10, when we change the value of `obj2.a`, it is reflected in the original object.

Finally, in line 12, even though we are calling method `showA()` of `obj1`, the changed value of `a` (`"Banana"`) is printed.
